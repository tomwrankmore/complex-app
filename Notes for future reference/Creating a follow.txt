When we create a follow document in the follows collection, there is an authorId field which is the id of the logged in user and a followedId which is the id of the profile user whose page we call the follow function from.

Therefore when finding a list of followers we run agg operations on mongo to find follow documents where followedId is the same as req.profileUser._id/'id', because that would return all the documents where the user id shows up as one of the profiles that has been followed.

When finding a list of following, we look for documents where the profile id matches the authorId.

Let me just define what req.profileUser._id is.
ifUserExists calls User.findByUserName passing along (req.params.username) as 'username'
findByUserName runs findOne method on usersCollection to find a document that matches username with username field in database, if it resolves then it passes the whole document into function as 'userDoc'
reducedUserDoc new instance of User, passing in userDoc, just to get avatar I think.
We strip down reducedUserDoc to three properties:
          _id: reducedUserDoc.data._id,
          username: reducedUserDoc.data.username,
          avatar: reducedUserDoc.avatar

Resolve with 'reducedUserDoc' ie. pass reducedUserDoc back to userController.ifUserExists
in the .then userDocument is passed, which is === reducedUserDoc
Then we create a property on the req object called profileUser = userDocument


Long story short: req.profileUser is a user document based on the username in the url bar on a profile page.
