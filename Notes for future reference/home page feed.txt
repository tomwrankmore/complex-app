userController home function
We create variable called posts which runs getFeed function 

getfeed function
takes in id as argument from within home function in userController

then sets followedUsers to mongo operation 'find' docs where authorId is the same as id/ie. req.session.user._id/logged in user's id. So that's all the follow docs that the logged in user has created. 

Then we convert .toArray() 
Then use map method on followedUsers, passing in followDoc as current indexed item, then return followDoc.followedId from inside each of the followDocs.
Remember map returns new array. 

So the new array returned is just the followedId fields from all docs in the followsCollection that the logged in user created.

reusablePostQuery() is going to look up the user's user name and figure out their gravatar.
Agg operation we pass in: {$match: {author: {$in: followedUsers}}}
This is saying: find any post doc where author value is in our array of followedUsers. reusablePostQuery resolves with 'posts'.
We make posts available to profile.ejs in home function
.
So here posts represents an array of posts where the author field is in followedUsers array.
  Initially we find all follows created by our logged in user
  then run map on that array to return only returning the followedId fields as array items

then we run reusablePostQuery to find posts that are created by author's the same as id's in followedUsers array.
