Shared profile data function in userController is to be reused when sending requests on posts, followers and following from /profile pages
It's function is to use the current profile id and the logged in user id to check if they're following them.


 in router.js on /profile/:user route add as second function

 sharedProfileData function exists in userController  
 isFollowing is initially set to false
 if (req.session.user) logged in ie user object exists
 run Follow.isVisitorFollowing method
 pass in (req.profileUser._id) which is on req object from ifUserExists function as well as req.visitorId from app.js, always available

req.profileUser._id = id of the profile page that we're on.

profileUser comes from reusablePostQuery

 isVisitorFollowing returns true of false so set isFollowing to isVisitorFollowing
 then add this onto req object req.isFollowing = isFollowing, local variable which is true or false based on isVisitorFollowing method
 call next() to move onto next function
 
Follow.isVisitorFollowing:
takes in req.profileUser._id, req.visitorId as followedId & visitorId
variable called followDoc = findOne method on followsCollection
where followedId is the same as OUR followedId we passed in &
where authorId is the same as OUR visitorId we passed in as mongoDb objectID like:
  authorId: new ObjectID(this.authorId)

if (followDoc) exists return true, else return false 

So again:
sharedProfileData function runs for ALL profile routes
by default isFollowing is set to false
but if current visitor is logged in ie if(req.session.user)
we set is following to Follow.isVisitorFollowing to check to see is logged in user is following the current profile, returns true or false
we store that value in req.isFollowing so that we can use it in the next() function in this route - profilePostsScreen()

when we res.render('profile') in profilePostsScreen() pass in new data:
  isFollowing: req.isFollowing which is true or false

Now we can use true or false value to show either follow or unfollow button

profile.ejs - if(user) - ie if user is logged in then inside that
if - isFollowing is true - show unfollow button and change action to /removeFollow
else - show follow button which runs addFollow
